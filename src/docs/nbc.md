This class provides a gentle introduction to the Bayesian approach to Supervised Learning. We will consider the question of estimating the distribution of a label $y$ given an input $x$ and some data. A first, very naive way to tackle this problem will involve a strong hypothesis of conditional independence, which we will call the naive Bayes assumption. This will open the door to the method of Naive Bayes Classification.
